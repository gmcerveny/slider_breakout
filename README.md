# Slider Breakout PCB

!(/slider_breakout.png)

Designed for use in prototyping creative musical interfaces.  Great
for cross faders, levels, synthesizers, sequencers, or transport
control.

This PCB design is a breakout board for a Bourns PTA3043-2015CPB103
30mm slide potentiometer.  

The breakout board design utilizes staggered jumpers so the board may
be placed vertically or horizontally on a breadboard.

The pin outs are mirrored so that if the physical direction of the
board is rotated, the resistance pins will be swapped. This allows a
user to change the direction of a slider without altering other
aspects of the circuit or software design.
